<h1>About Me ðŸ¤”</h1>
Hey there! I'm a software developer who loves learning and growing. I'm on the lookout for a cool team that's ready to let me shine and be a key player.

I've got a degree in Web Media and have done some pretty neat stuff in videography, photography, and design. These gigs taught me a lot about problem-solving and just getting things done. I'm all about teamwork and making sure we're on the same page.

I've always been a curious person, always learning and creating. That's why I decided to switch things up and get into software development. I've been on a journey with The Odin Project, learning a ton and building the skills I use every day as a developer. TOP is great because I can go at my own pace, and it's all about projects. Thanks to their curriculum, I'm super confident I can learn whatever I need, no matter the tech stuff.

When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me playing video games, reading, or cooking up something tasty for my family.
