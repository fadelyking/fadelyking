<h1>About Me ðŸ¤”</h1>
Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a passionate software developer eager to learn and grow. I'm currently on the lookout for a dynamic team that values collaboration and allows me to contribute significantly.

<h1>Background ðŸŽ“</h1>
I hold a degree in Web Media and have gained valuable experience in videography, photography, and design. These roles have honed my problem-solving skills and taught me the importance of getting things done as a team.

<h2>Journey into Software Development ðŸ’»</h2>
I've always been a curious soul, constantly learning and creating. This curiosity led me to make a career shift into software development. I'm currently immersed in an exciting journey with The Odin Project, where I'm not only learning a ton but also building the skills necessary for my everyday work as a developer. The self-paced, project-centric nature of TOP perfectly aligns with my learning style. Thanks to their curriculum, I'm incredibly confident that I can adapt and learn anything, regardless of the tech stack.

<h2>Life Beyond Code ðŸŒŸ</h2>
When I'm not immersed in coding, you'll likely find me exploring the virtual realms of video games, getting lost in a good book, or whipping up something delicious in the kitchen for my family.
